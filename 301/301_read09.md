## [Concepts of Functional Programming in JavaScript](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

### Pure functions

- Pure functions return the same result if given the ame arguments (deterministic)

```
let pi = 3.14;
const calculateArea = (radius, pi) => radius * radius * pi;
calculateArea(10, pi); // returns 314.0
```

In the above example, using `10` and `pi` as the 1st and 2nd respective arguments when calling the `calculateArea()` function will always result in the same answer.


- Pure functions do not cause any observable side effects
  - *Example*: observable side effects include modifying a global object or a parameter passed by reference

  ```
  let counter = 1;

  function increaseCounter(value) {
    counter = value + 1;
  }
  ```
  - mutability is discouraged in functional programming

#### Reading Files

- since the external contents of a file can change, a function is not a pure function if it reads external files.

#### Random number generation

- function isn't pure if it relies on a random number generator

### Immutability

- **immutability**: when data is immutable, its state cannot change after it's created. Since you can't change an immutable object, you instead create a new object with the new value.

### Referential transparency

- if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
  - **pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency
- [Memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization): speeds up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached results when the same inputs occur again

### Functions as first-class entities

- functions are also treated as values **_and_** used as data
- as first class entities can:
  - refer to it from constants and variables
  pass it as a parameter to other functions
  return it as results from other functions

```
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
const subtraction = (a, b) => a - b;

const doubleOperator = (f, a, b) => f(a, b) * 2;

doubleOperator(sum, 3, 1); // 8
doubleOperator(subtraction, 3, 1); // 4
```

### Higher-order functions

Functions that either:
- takes one or more functions as arguments, or
- returns a function as its result
- `doubleOperator()` is an example of a higher-order function

### Filter

- if the callback expression is `true`, the filter function will include the element in the result collection

```
const even = n => n % 2 === 0;
const listOfNumbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
listOfNumbers.filter(even); // [0, 2, 4, 6]
```

### Map

The `map()` method applies a function to all of a collection's elements and builds a new collection from the returned values.

```
const makeSentence = (person) => `${person.name} is ${person.age} years old`;
const peopleSentences = (people) => people.map(makeSentence);

peopleSentences(people);
// ['TK is 26 yearls old', 'Kaio is 10 years old', 'Kazumi is 30 years old'];
```

### Reduce

- receive a function and a collection, and return a valeu created by combining the items.

```
let shoppingCart = [
  { productTitle: "product 1", amount: 10 },
  { productTitle: "product 2", amount: 20 }
];

cont sumAmount = (currentTotalAmount, order) => currentTotalAmount + order.amount;

const getTotalAmount = (shoppingCart) => shoppingCart.reduce(sumAmount, 0);

getTotalAmount(shoppingCart); // 120
```

## [Refactoring JavaScript for Performance and Readability](https://dev.to/healeycodes/refactoring-javascript-for-performance-and-readability-with-examples-1hec)

### Unrefactored code

```
const urlStore = [];

function makeShort(url) {
  const rndName = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2);
  urlStore.push({[rndName]: url});
  return rndName;
}

function getLong(shortUrl) {
  for (let i = 0; i < urlStore.length; i++) {
    if (urlStore[i].hasOwnProperty(shortUrl) !== false) {
      return urlStore[i][shortUrl];
    }
  }
}
```

### Refactored code

```
const urlStore = new Map(); // Change this to a Map

function makeShort(url) {
  const rndName = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2);
  // Place the short url into the Map as the key with the long url as the value
  urlStore.set(rndName, url);
  return rndName;
}

function getLong(shortUrl) {
  // Leave the function early to avoid an unnecessary else statement
  if (urlStore.has(shortUrl) === false) {
    throw 'Not in urlStore!';
  }
  return urlStore.get(shortUrl); // get the long url out of the Map
}
```
