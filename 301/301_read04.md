# Reading Assignment 04

## Notes from [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/)

- `grid-column-start`: to choose which vertical row with a number

- `grid-column-end`: use this with `grid-column-start` to span over multiple columns

- the above two options can take positive or negative values to choose which direction you want to span

- shorthand: `grid-column` will accept two values

```
grid-column: 2 / 4;
```

- `grid-row-start` to choose the row

- shorthand example: `grid-row: 2 / 4` meaning it will begin at two and span two rows

- `grid-area` to combine columns and rows

```
grid-area: 1 / 1 / 3 / 3;
```

which is shorthand for designating like this:

- grid-row-start / grid-column start / grid-row-end / grid-column-end

- `order` property is similar to `z-index` in how you control elements

```
order: 6;
```

- `grid-template-columns: 50%` halves the columns template
- `grid-template-rows: 50%` does the same thing but with rows
