## [Responsive Web Design - Shay Howe](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/responsive-web-design/)

Responsive Web Design (RWD) is the approach to building websites suitable for all users.

### Responsive Overview

- **RWD**: building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size

#### Responsive vs. Adaptive vs Mobile

- **Responsive**: react quickly and positively to any change
- **Adaptive**: easily modified for a new purpose or situation
- **Mobile**: build a website on a new domain solely for mobile users (not recommended)
- RWD is the favored approach because the design will dynamicaly adapt to different browser and device viewports, changing layout and content along the way
 - Benefits of all three: **responsive, adaptive, mobile**

### Flexible Layouts

**Flexible grids**: using relative length units; i.e., percentages or `em` units

Example:

```
section, aside {
  margin: 1.859% /* instead of hard coding the pixels, do a calculation so the proportions remain the same regardless of viewport size */
}
```

### Media Queries

Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances

#### Initializing Media Queries

Examples:

- HTML (not recommended; should avoid additional HTML requests)

```
<!-- Separate CSS File -->
<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" media="all and (max-width: 1024px)">
```

- CSS

```
/* @media Rule */
@media all and max-width: 1024 px) {...}

/* @import Rule to import a new style sheet */
@import url(styles.css) all and (max-width: 1024px) {...}
```

- Common media types
  - `all`
  - `screen` (default if media type isn't specified)
  - `print`
  - `tv`
  - `braille`

#### Logical Operators in Media Queries

Can use `and`, `not`, and `only`

##### Using Minimum and Maximum Prefixes

- `min` and `max` prefixes avoid any conflict with HTML syntax (i.e., using `<` and `>` symbols)

##### Orientation Media Feature

- `orientation`: `landscape` or `portrait`

##### Aspect Ratio Media Features

- `aspect-ratio` and `device-aspect-ratio` specify `width/height` pixel ratio for targeted rendering area or output device

Example:

```
@media all and (min-device-aspect-ratio: 16/9) {...}
```

##### Pixel Ratio Media Features

```
@media only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.3), only screen and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.3) {...}
```

##### Resolution Media Feature
Specifies the resolution of output device in pixel density (dots per inch)

```
@media print and (min-resolution: 300dpi) {...}
```

##### Other Media Features

Identifying available output colors using `color`, `color-index`, `monochrome`, `grid`, `scan`

- [Respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond/)
- [MediaQueries.js](https://code.google.com/p/css3-mediaqueries-js/) but keep in mind any polyfill can have performance concerns

### Mobile First

Using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles; designing with constraints of a mobile user in mind

Downloading unnecessary media assts can be stopped by using media queries

When CSS3 features are used excessively, it can cause heavy loading and inefficient battery life

### Viewport

#### Height and Width

Best to apply `device-height` and `device-width` values

```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
```

#### Scale

Controlling how a website is scaled on a mobile device:

- `minimum-scale`, `maximum-scale`, `initial-scale` (should be set to `1`), `user-scalable` (positive integers between `0` and `10`)

```
<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=2">
```

Turning off the ability to scale a website **_harms accessibility and usability_**, so don't do it.

```
<meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=yes">
```

#### Viewport Resolution

When more control is needed: `target-densitydpi`

- Acceptable values
  - `device-dpi`, `high-dpi`, `medium-dpi`, `low-dpi`, or an actual DPI number

```
content="target-densitydpi=device-dpi`
```

#### Combining Viewport Values

```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

### Flexible Media

```
max-width: 100%;
```

#### Flexible Embedded Media

For embedded media to be fully responsive, the element needs to be absolutely positioned within a parent element; the parent needs a `width` of `100%` and a `height` of `0` to trigger the `hasLayout` mechanism within IE

Padding given to bottom of parent element allows height of parent to be proportionate to its width

## [All About Floats - Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/)

- Boxes can be told to honor or ignore text wraps

- Floated elements remain a part of the flow of hte web page

- Four valid properties: `left`, `right`, `none`, `inherit` (assumes float value of parent element)

### Clearing the Float

`clear` property moves and element down past the float

- has four values:
  - `both` clears floats from either direction
  - `left` and `right` clear floats from one direction
  - `none` is default; unnecessary unless removing a clear value from a cascade
  - **a fifth value**: `inherit` (not supported by IE)

### The Great Collapse

If the parent element contains nothing but floated elements, the height of it would collapse; this is fixed by **clearing the float after the floated elements in the container but before the close of the container**

### Techniques for Clearing Floats

- if you always know what the succeeding element will be: `clear: both;`
- **Empty Div Method**

```
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
```

- **Overflow Method**

Set the overflow CSS property on a parent element (`auto` or `hidden`); be mindful of unwanted scroll bars

- **Easy Clearing Method**

CSS pseudo selector `:after` instead of setting overflow of parent

```
.clearfix:after {
  content: ".";
  visibility: hidden;
  display: block;
  height: 0;
  clear: both;
}
```

### Problems With Floats

(majority come from IE6 bugs)

- **Pushdown**: when element inside a floated item is wider than the float itself
  - Quickfix: `overflow: hidden`
- **Double Margin Bug**: the margin will double if you apply a margin in the same direction as the float
  - Quickfix: `display: inline`
- **3px Jog**: text next to a floated element is kicked away
  - Quickfix: setting `width` or `height` on affected text
- **Bottom Margin Bug** (IE7): bottom margin of children ignored by parent if floated parent has floated children inside it
  - Quickfix: use bottom `padding` on parent instead
