## [Database Normalization](https://www.essentialsql.com/get-ready-to-learn-sql-database-normalization-explained-in-simple-english/)

### Reasons for Database Normalization

- minimize duplicate data
- minimize/avoid  data modification issues
- simplify queries

### Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies

#### Insert Anomaly

- when there are facts we cannot record until we know information for the entire row.

#### Update Anomaly

- When information needs to be changed that requires multiple updates to be made, not updating *all* the rows will lead to inconsistencies.

#### Deletion Anomaly

- When deletio of a row causes removal of more than one set of facts.

### Search and Sort Issues

- Keeping like information in similar columns makes it easier to run queries

### Normal Forms

Each successive form must satisfy the rules for the previous form

- **[First Normal Form](https://www.essentialsql.com/get-ready-to-learn-sql-8-database-first-normal-form-explained-in-simple-english/)** - The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.
- **[Second Normal Form](https://www.essentialsql.com/get-ready-to-learn-sql-10-database-second-normal-form-explained-in-simple-english/)** - The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table's primary key.
- **[Third Normal Form](https://www.essentialsql.com/get-ready-to-learn-sql-11-database-third-normal-form-explained-in-simple-english/)** - The table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
