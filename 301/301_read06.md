## [An Introduction to Node.js](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)

To check what Node version you have: `node -v`
### Node.js Has Excellent Support for Modern JavaScript

- you can use the most modern syntax and in general not worry about compatibility issues in different browsers

To run a .js file in Terminal:

```
node <FILENAME>.js
```

### Introducing npm, the JavaScript Package Manager

To check which npm version you have: `npm -v`

- npm is the package manager for JavaSript, and is also the world's largest software registry

#### Installing a Package Globally

Installing jshint:

```
npm install -g jshint
```

Linting a JavaScript file:

```
jshint index.js
```

To fix ES6-related errors, add the following code at the top of your JavaScript file:

```
/* jshint esversion: 6 */
```

#### Installing a Package Locally

```
npm init -y
```

This above will create and auto-populate a `package.json` file in teh same folder

```
npm install lodash --save
```

This above will install the lodash package and save it as a project dependency.

```
const _ = require('lodash');

const arr = [0, 1, false, 2, '', 3];
console.log(_.compact(arr));
```

- when you run the script using `node test <FILENAME>.js`, `[1, 2, 3]` will be the output to the terminal

- `node_modules` folder shouldn't be checked in to version control; can be re-created at any time by running `npm install` from within the project's root
