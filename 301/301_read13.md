## [MDN Docs: Sending Form Data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data)

### Defining how to send the data

#### The action attribute

- `action` attribute defines **_where_** the data gets sent (must be a valid relative or absolute URL)
  - `action` value is a file on teh server that can handle the incoming data

``` ejs
<form action="/some_folder">
```

- when specified with no attributes, the form data is sent to the same page that the form is present on

``` ejs
<form>
```

#### The method attribute

- `method` attribute defines **_how_** data is sent, with an [HTML protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP).

  - `GET` method: browser asks the server to send back a given resource.
  - `POST` method: This is like the browser saying: "Hey server, take a look at thi sdata and send me back an appropriate result."

#### Viewing HTTP requests

- these requests are never displayed to the user.
  - Examples of tools to view HTTP requests:
    - [Firefox Network Monitor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Network_Monitor)
    - [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/)
- With a `GET` request the user will see the data in their URL bar, but not with a `POST` request
  - **_NEVER_**, **_EVER!!!_** use the `GET` method for sending sensitive data

#### On the server side: retrieving the data

- [For Node.js: Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/forms)

### Sending Files

#### The enctype attribute

- set the `method` attribute to POST, because file content can't be put inside URL parameters
- set value of `enctype` to `multipart/form-data` because the data will be split into multiple parts, one for each file plus one for the text data included in the form body (if text is also entered into the form).
- Include one or more `<input type="file">` controls to allow your users to select the flie(s) that will be uploaded.

``` ejs
<form method ="POST" action="https://www.foo.com" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <div>
    <label for="file">Choose a file</label>
    <input type="file" id="file" name="myFile">
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Send the file</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

### Security issues

#### Be paranoid: Never trust your users

- All data that comes to your server must be checked and sanitized. **_ALWAYS_**.
  - **Escape potentially dangerous characters**.
    - Character sequences that look like executable code (e.g., JavaScript or SQL commands)
  - **Limit the incoming amount of data to allow only what's necessary**.
  - **Sandbox uploaded files**.
    - Store them on a different server and allow access to the file only through a different subdomain or even better through a completely different domain.

## [HTML5 Forms Reference - "action" and "method" attributes](https://htmlreference.io/forms/)

- `action` defines which URL the form's information is sent to when submitted
- `method` defines the HTTP method used when submitting the form.
  - `"POST"`: the form info is sent to the server as part of the **request body**
  - `"GET"`: the form info is sent to the server as part of the URL parameters
    - Example: `/contact?first_name=Alex&last_name=Smith`
