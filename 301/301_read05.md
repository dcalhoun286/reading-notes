## [Heroku: Getting Started with Node](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction)

### Setup

- Download and run the installer (for macOS):

```
brew install heroku/brew/heroku
```

Now the `heroku` command can be used from Terminal

- Log in to the Heroku CLI:

```
heroku login
```

This above will generate a response prompting you to sign in to Heroku via a web browser.

- Check for correct version of Node:

```
node --version
```

- Check for `npm` version (`npm` is installed with Node):

```
npm --version
```

- Check for `git` version:

```
git --version
```

### Prepare the app (this step will prepare a sample app that's ready to deploy to Heroku)

- Clone a local version of the sample app:

```
git clone https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started.git
```

- change into the directory you just cloned:

```
cd node-js-getting-started
```

### Deploy the app

- Create an app on Heroku!

```
heroku create
```

- Time to deploy your code!

```
git push heroku main
```

- Ensure that at least one isntance of the app is running:

```
heroku ps:scale web=1
```

- Visit the app at the URL generated by its app name:

```
heroku open
```

### View logs

- View information about your runnin gapp using one of the [logging commands](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging):

```
heroku logs --tail
```

Press `Control+C` to stop streaming the logs.
