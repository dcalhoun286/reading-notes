## My thoughts/what stood out to me

- The NPR article reminded me of some of my own stories as well as stories shared by friends. I remember things like being in the "advanced" classes in gradeschool, and my being there being questioned as likely the result of special treatment, when I in fact tested into the program like everyone else. I think about my (women) friends in their science/tech/engineering fields who tell me they are often the only woman in their class, or one of very few women in their cohort. I know that systemic change takes time, but I'm glad to see more conversation regarding its necessity.
- The conclusion at the end of the USA Today article: "But it's only a first step. After deciding that diversity matters and articulating its importance, leaders must create a strategy for building a more diverse, inclusive company and an accountability plan to ensure that strategy is effective." I think this is so true. It is one thing to acknowledge the reality of something; it is another thing to *do* something about it.
