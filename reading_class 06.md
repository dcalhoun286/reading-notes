#### **How HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Fit Together**

* As much as possible, keep CSS (.css) and JavaScript (.js) content in separate files from HTML (.html) content
    * Keeping JavaScript separate allows the page to still work if the user can't load or run JavaScript 

#### **Progressive Enhancement**

* JavaScript is added last; enhances the usability and/or the experience of interacting with the site
* JavaScript can be reused on several pages (faster to load; easier to maintain)
