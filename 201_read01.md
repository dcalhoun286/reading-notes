## HTML & CSS Textbook

### **Chapter 1: Structure**

#### HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages

- Tags:
  - The characters inside < > indicate the tag’s purpose
  - An opening tag: ```< >```		A closing tag: ```</ >```

- ```<html>``` Content located inside these tags is HTML code ```</html>```
  -	```</html>``` indicates that it is the end of the HTML code
- ```<body>``` Content in these tags is shown inside the main browser window ```</body>```
  -	```</body>``` indicates the end of what should appear in the main browser window
- ```<h1>``` A main heading ```</h1>```
- ```<p>``` A paragraph of text ```</p>```
- ```<h2>``` A sub-heading ```</h2>```
- ```<p>``` Another paragraph of text ```</p>```
- ```<h2>``` Another sub-heading ```</h2>```
- ```<p>``` Another paragraph of text ```</p>```

#### Attributes Tell Us More About Elements

- Attributes give us more info about an element
  - Two parts – attribute name and attribute value, separated by an equals sign
  - Example:
     - ```<p lang=”en-us”>```Paragraph in English```</p>```

#### Body, Head & Title

- ```<head>``` element 
  - appears before ```<body>``` element
  - contains info about the page (but is not shown within the main part of the browser window)
     - usually find a ```<title>``` element within the ```<head>```

- ```<title>``` element
  - Anything written between the ```<title>``` tags will appear I the title bar (or tabs) at the top of the browser window
- ```<body>``` element
  - Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window

#### Creating a Web Page On a Mac

- Use text editor; e.g., VS Code, TextEdit, TextWrangler
- Code should be nested like this:

```
<html>
	<head>
		<title>My First Web Page</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Welcome to My First Web Page</h1>
		<p>This is an HTML page that I created in VS Code.</p>
	<body>
</html>
```

#### Code in a Content Management System

- Usually log into a special administration section of the website to control the webpage
- Tools provided typically allow you to edit parts of the page rather than the entire page, so you will rarely see the ```<html>```, ```<head>```, or ```<body>``` elements

#### Looking At How Other Sites Are Built

- Go to the web browser’s View menu and click on an option that allows you to see the source code behind a web page.

### **Chapter 8: “Extra Markup”**

#### Doctypes

- There have been several versions of HTML; each web page should begin with a ```DOCTYPE``` declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using
- The use of a ```DOCTYPE``` can also help the browser to render a page correctly
- HTML5: ```<!DOCTYPE html>```

#### Comments in HTML

```<!-- This is a comment. -->```

- Comments made are not visible in the user’s browser
- When you come back to your code later (or if someone else needs to look at the code), comments will make it much easier to understand.
- Comments can also be used around blocks of code to stop that code from being displayed in the browser.

#### ID Attribute

- Known as a global attribute because it can be used on any HTML element
- It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page
- Giving an element a unique identity allows you to style it in CSS differently from any other instance of the same element on the page

#### Class Attribute

- Also a global attribute
- Can be used on multiple elements to alter their presentation in CSS differently from any other elements
- An element can belong to multiple classes (separate class names with a space)
  - Example:
        ```
        <p class=”important admittance”>
        ```

        This element has two classes: important and admittance

#### Block Elements & Inline Elements

- Block elements always start on a new line; take up the full width available
  - Examples: ``` <head> <body> <h1> <p> <ul> <li> ```
- Inline elements continue on the same line as their neighboring elements; only take up as much space as necessary
  - Examples: ``` <a> <b> <em> <img> <span>```

#### Grouping Text & Elements In a Block; Grouping Text & Elements Inline

- ```<div>``` allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box
- It can also make it easier to follow your code if you have used ```<div>``` elements to hold each section of the page
- Add a comment after the closing end tag to clearly see which opening tag it is supposed to correspond to

- ```<span>``` acts like the inline equivalent of ```<div>```; used to do either of these things:
  - Contains a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text, or
  - Contains a number of inline elements
  - A ```class``` or ```id``` attribute is usually used with ```span``` elements to explain the purpose of the ```<span>``` element and/or so that CSS styles can be applied to elements that have specific values for these attributes

#### Iframes

- The term iframe is short for inline frame
- ```<iframe>``` Used for embedding a page within a page
- The content of the iframe can be any html page (either located on the same server or anywhere else on the web)
- ```<iframe>``` uses the following attributes:
  - ```src``` specifies the URL of the page to show in the frame
  - ```height``` specifies the height of the iframe in pixels
  - ```width``` specifies the width of the iframe in pixels
  - ```scrolling``` (not supported in HTML5)
     - In HTML 4 and XHTML, indicates whether the iframe should have scrollbars or not (values can be either ```yes```, ```no```, or ```auto```)
     - Example:
     ```scrolling=”no”```

  - ```seamless``` (introduced in HTML5, not supported by older browsers) can be applied to an iframe where scrollbars are not desired. ```seamless``` does not need a value

#### Information About Your Pages

- ```<meta>``` element lives inside the ```<head>``` element and contains information about that web page; doesn’t have a closing tag because it is an empty element
  - Not visible to users but fulfills multiple purposes, e.g., telling search engines about your page, or who created it
- Example:

    ```
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Information About Your Pages</title>
            <meta name=”description”
                content=”An Essay on Installation Art” />
            <meta name=”keywords”
                content=”installation, art, opinion” />
            <meta name=”robots”
                content=”nofollow” />
            <meta http-equiv=”author”
                content=”Jon Duckett” />
            <meta http-equiv=”pragma”
                content=”no-cache” />
            <meta http-equiv=”expires”
                content=”Fri, 04 Apr 2014 23:59:59 GMT” />
        </head>
        <body>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```
- ```description``` is commonly used by search engines to understand what the page is about; should be max 155 characters; sometimes also displayed in search engine results
- ```keywords``` contains a list of comma-separated words that a user might search on to find the page; no longer has a noticeable effect on how search engines index your site
- ```robots``` indicates whether search engines should add this page to their search results or not
  - ```noindex``` value is used if page shouldn’t be added
  - ```nofollow``` value is used if page should be added, but not any pages that it links to
- ```author``` defines the author of the page
- ```pragma``` prevents the browser from caching the page (i.e., storing it locally to save time downloading it on subsequent visits)
- ```expires```: For when browsers cache the content of a page, the ```expires``` option can be used to indicate when the page should expire (the date must have the format indicated in the example above)

#### Escape Characters

There are some characters that are used in and reserved by HTML code; in order for them to appear in the page instead of being interpreted as code, you must use an escape code associated with that character. List of examples below is not exhaustive.

- Less-than sign (<):		```&lt;```	```&#60;```
- Greater-than sign (>):		```&gt;```	```&#62;```
- Ampersand (&):		```&amp;```	```&#38;```
- Quotation mark (“):		```&quot;```	```&#34;```
- Cent sign (¢):			```&cent;```	```&#162;```
- Pound sign (£):		```&pound;```	```&#163;```
- Yen sign (¥):			```&yen;```	```&#165;```
- Euro sign (€):			```&euro;```	```&#8364;```
- Copyright symbol (©):	```&copy;```	```&#169;```
- Registered trademark (®):	```&reg;```	```&#174;```
- Trademark (™):		```&trade;```	```&#8482;```
- Left single quote (‘):		```&lsquo;```	```&#8216;```
- Right single quote (’):		```&rsquo;```	```&#8217;```
- Left double quotes (“):	```&ldquo;```	```&#8220;```
- Right double quotes (”):	```&rdquo;```	```&#8221;```
- Multiplication sign (*):	```&times;```	```*#215;```
- Division sign (÷):		```&divide;```	```*#247;```					


### **Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout”**

#### Traditional HTML Layouts vs HTML5 Layout Elements

Web page authors used to use ```<div>``` elements to group together related elements on the page, using ```class``` or ```id``` attributes to indicate the role of the ```<div>``` element in the structure of the page

In HTML5, many of the <div> elements have been replaced by new HTML5 layout elements.
- The header sits inside the ```<header>``` element
- The navigation sits inside the ```<nav>``` element
- Articles are in individual ```<article>``` elements
- The new elements make the code easier to follow

#### Headers & Footers

- ```<header>``` and ```<footer>``` elements can be used the main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the website as well as a header or footer for an individual ```<article>``` or ```<section>``` within the page

#### Navigation

- ```<nav>``` is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation
- ```<nav>``` is sometimes used at the bottom of every page for links to things such as privacy policy, terms and conditions, accessibility information

#### Articles

- ```<article>``` acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated
- Each individual article lives inside its own ```<article>``` element if a page contains several articles
- ```<article>``` elements can be nexted inside each other.

#### Asides

- ```<aside>``` element has two purposes, depending on whether or not it is inside an ```<article>``` element
  - When inside – should contain info that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. Examples: pullquote, glossary
  - When outside – acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page. Examples: links to other sections of the site, list of recent posts, search box, recent tweets by author

#### Sections

- ```<section>``` groups related content together; each section would typically have its own heading
- It may contain several distinct ```<article>``` elements that have a common theme or purpose
- It can also be used to split an article up into separate sections
- Should not be used as a wrapper for the entire page. Use ```<div>``` instead

#### Heading Groups

- ```<hgroup>``` groups together a set of one or more ```<h1>``` through ```<h6>``` elements so that they are treated as one single heading.
- Some developers do not like this element; instead, they prefer to list a subtitle within a ```<p>``` element and use an attribute to indicate it’s a subheading

#### Figures

- ```<figure>``` can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of the article
- The article should still make sense if the content in ```<figure>``` were moved
- ```<figure>``` should only bre used when the content simply references the element, not something that is absolutely integral for the flow of a page
- The ```<figure>``` element should also contain a ```<figcaption>``` element which provides a text description for the content of the ```<figure>``` element

#### Sectioning Elements

Where there is no suitable element to group a set of elements, the ```<div>``` element will still be used, e.g., when it is used as a wrapper for the entire page

#### Linking Around Block-Level Elements

- HTML5 allows for an ```<a>``` element to be placed around a block-level element that contains child elements. This allows you to turn an entire block into a link.
- Earlier versions of HTML do not regard this as correct usage of ```<a>```

#### Helping Older Browsers Understand

Older browsers that do not know the new HTML5 elements will automatically treat them as inline elements.
- Include the line of CSS below which states which new elements should be rendered as block-level elements:

    ```
    Header, section, footer, aside, nav, article, figure, figcaption {
        Display: block;
    }
    ```

- In order to style these elements using versions of Internet Explorer earlier than IE9, you need to use a JavaScript known as the HTML5 shiv or HTML5 shim (requires JavaScript enabled in their browser in order to see the content of the HTML5 elements). It should be inside a conditional comment which checks if the browser version is less than IE9:

    ```
    <!--[if lt IE 9]>
        <script src=”http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js”></script>
    <![endif]-->
    ```


### **Chapter 18: Process & Design**


#### Who is the site for?

- Target audience (individuals): What are their demographics?
- Target audience (companies): size, roles of individuals at that company who’d potentially use your product/service

#### Why they are coming:

- Content must be presented in a way that makes it clear to the target audience that the webpage and info therein is relevant to them

- Wireframes:
  - An organized skeleton of what your webpage might look like

#### Visual hierarchy:

- Refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see; higher contrast between the items are recognized and processed first
- helps users prioritize most important and key information by customizing size, color, style, images


## JavaScript Textbook

### **Chapter 1: The ABC of Programming**

#### Writing a Script

1.	Define the goal
    1. What is the task you want to achieve?
2.	Design the script
    1. Split the goal out into a series of tasks, such as in the form of a flowchart
    2. Write out the individual steps the computer needs to perform to complete each individual task, as well as any info it needs to perform the task
3. Code each step
    1. Write each step in a programming language the computer understands (e.g., JavaScript)

#### From Steps to Code

You need to learn to “think” like a computer; computers solve tasks in different ways than humans might approach them

**_Example – Finding the Tallest Person_**

1. Find the height of the first person
2. Assume they are the “tallest person”
3. Look at the height of the remaining people one-by-one and compare their height to the “tallest person” you have found so far
4. At each step, if you find someone whose height is greater than the current “tallest person”, they become the new “tallest person”
5. Once you have checked all the people, tell me which one is the tallest

#### How a Browser Sees a Web Page

**How does a browser interpret HTML code and apply styling to it?**

1. Receive a page as HTML code
    1. Each page on a website can be seen as a separate document
2. Create a model of the page and store it in memory
3. Use a rendering engine to show the page on screen
    1. If there is no CSS file that is linked to the HTML file, the rendering engine will apply default styles to HTML elements
    2. When a browser receives the CSS rules, the rendering engine processes them and applies each rule to its corresponding elements

- All major browsers use a JavaScript interpreter to translate the instructions into instructions the computer can follow 
    - In an interpreted programming language like JavaScript, each line of code is translated one-by-one 

#### How HTML, CSS, & JavaScript Fit Together

- HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics
- CSS enhances the HTML page with rules for how the HTML content is presented
- JavaScript is used to control how the HTML page behaves

#### Creating a Basic JavaScript

**Example:**

```
var today = new Date();
var hourNow = today.getHours();
var greeting;

if (hourNow > 18) {
	greeting = ‘Good evening!’;
} else if (hourNow > 12) {
	greeting = ‘Good afternoon!’;
} else {
		greeting = ‘Welcome!’;
}

document.write(‘<h3>’ + greeting + ‘</h3>’);
```

#### Linking to a JavaScript File From An HTML Page

Use the ```<script>``` element to tell the browser it is coming across a script; the ```src``` attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Title of Page</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<script src=”js/add-content.js”></script>
	</body>
</html>
```
