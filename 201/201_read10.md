### Chapter 10: Error Handling and Debugging

#### Order of Execution

- Know how scripts are processed; some tasks cannot complete until another statement or function has been run

#### Execution Contexts

- Execution context
  - global context: code that is in the script, but not in a function
  - function context: code that is being run within a function
  - eval context
- Variable scope
  - global scope: if a variable is declared outside a function, it can be used anywhere because it has global scope. If you do not use the `var` keyword when creating a variable, it is placed in global scope.
  - function-level scope: when a variable is declared within a function, it can only be used within that function.

#### The Stack

The JavaScript interpreter processes one line of code at a time. When a statement needs data from another function, it stacks (or piles) the new function on top of the current task.

#### Error Objects

- `error`: generic error - the other errors are all based upon this error
- `SyntaxError`: Syntax has not been followed
- `ReferenceError`: Tried to reference a variable that is not declared/within scope
- `TypeError`: An unexpected data type that cannot be coerced
- `RangeError`: Numbers not in acceptable range
- `URIError`: `encodeURI()`, `decodeURI()`, and similar methods used incorrectly
- `EvalError`: `eval()` function used incorrectly

#### How to Deal With Errors

- Debug the script to fix errors - track down the source of the error and fix it
- Handle errors gracefully - using `throw`, `try`, `catch`, and `finally` statements. **Particularly important to write error-handling code  in such cases where you request data from a third party and their server doesn't respond.

#### Browser Dev Tools and JavaScript Console

**_Chrome/Opera_**
- Mac:
  - F12 key, or
  - settings menu (top right) > developer tools

**_Firefox_**
- Mac:
  - Alt + Cmd + K, or
  - Tools menu > Web Developer > open the web console

**_Safari_**
- Alt + Cmd + C, or
- Develop Menu > Select Show Error Console
- If Develop menu is not shown:
  - Safari menu > select Preferences > Select Advanced > Check the box that says **"Show Develop menu in menu bar"**

#### Grouping Messages

You can use the `console.group()` method to group messages together; results can be expanded and contracted

```
console.group(`pick a name`);
  console.log(things);
  console.log(more things);
  console.info(even more things);
console.groupEnd();
```

#### Writing Tabular Data

`console.table()` lets you output a table showing objects, arrays that contain other objects or arrays

#### Writing on a Condition

`console.assert()` will only write to the console if the expression evaluates to `false`

#### Breakpoints

- You can pause the execution of a script on any line using breakpoints, then check the values stored in variables at that time

#### Stepping Through Code

- If you set multiple breakpoints, you can step through them one-by-one to see where value change and a problem might occur

#### Conditional Breakpoints

- You can indicate that a breakpoint should be triggered only if a condition that you specify is met. The condition can use existing variables.

#### Handling Exceptions

```
try {
  // Try to execute this code
} catch (exception) {
  // If there is an exception, run this code
} finally {
  // This always gets executed
}
```

#### Debugging Tips

- Another browser
- Add numbers
- Strip it back
- Explaining the code
- Search
- Code playgrounds
- Validation tools
  - JavaScript

    - [http://www.jshint.com](http://www.jshint.com)
  - JSON
    - [http://www.jsonlint.com](http://www.jsonlint.com)
  - JQUERY
    - jQuery debugger plugin available for Chrome which can be found in the Chrome web store
