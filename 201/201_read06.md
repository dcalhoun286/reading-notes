### **Chapter 3: Functions, Methods and Objectss (Object Literals)**

#### What is an Object?

- Group together a set of variables and functions. **Example**:

```
var hotel = {
  name: 'Quay',
  rooms: 40,
  booked: 25,
  gym: true,
  roomTypes: ['twin', 'double', 'suite'],
  checkAvailability: function() {
    return this.room - this.booked;
  }
}
```

#### Creating an Object: Literal Notation; Accessing an object: Dot Notation

- Literal notation is the easiest and most popular way to create objects.
- Access the properties or methods of an obejct using dot notation. You can also access proerties using square brackets.

### **Chapter 5: Document Object Model**

#### Caching Dom Queries

- When you need to work with an element more than once, you should use a variable to store the result of this query

#### Nodelists: DOM Queries That Return More Than One Element

- it returns a NodeList (even if it only finds one matchign element)

#### Selecting an element from a NodeList

- `item()` method and array syntax both require the index number of the element you want; array synax is faster

#### Selecting Elements Using Class Attributes

- `getElementsByClassName()`

#### Selecting Elements by Tag Name

- `getElementsByTagName()`

#### Selecting Elements Using CSS Selectors

- `querySelector()` returns the first element node that matches the CSS-style selector; `querySelectorAll()` returns a NodeList of all the matches
- only supported in more recent browsers

#### Repeating Actions for an Entire Nodelist

- you can loop through each node in the collection and apply the same statements to each with a `for` loop

#### Adding or Removing HTML Content

- `innerHTML` property and DOM manipulation

  - `innerHTML` will get the content of an element and return it as one long string, including any markup that the element contains

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks

- be aware of this when adding HTML using `innerHTML` or many jQuery methods

#### Defending Against Cross-Site Scripting

- Validate inpute going to the server
  - only let visitors input the kind of characters they need to when supplying information
  - Double-chek validation on the server before displaying user content/storing it in a database
  - Database may safely contain markup and script fron trusted sources
