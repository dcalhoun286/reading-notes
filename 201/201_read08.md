### **Chapter 15: Layout (repeat of reading from Class 04)**

#### Key Concepts in Positioning Elements

* Block-level elements start on a new line
  * **Examples**: `<h1> <p> <ul> <li>`
* Inline elements flow between surrounding text
  * **Examples**: `<img> <b> <i>`

#### Containing Elements

* Block-level elements can be parents of other block-level elements
  * It is common to group a number of elements together inside a `<div>` element. E.g., grouping elements that form the header of a website

#### Controlling the Position of Elements

* When you move any element out of normal flow, boxes can overlap. The `z-index` property allows you to control which box appears on top.

* **Fixed positioning**: Form of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browswer window; these fixed positioning elements do not affect position of surrounding elements

* **Relative positioning**: `position: relative` - moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow

#### Parents of Floated Elements

* **Using CSS to keep border of containing element from collapsing**

```
div {
  border: 1px
  overflow: auto;
  width: 100%;
}
```

#### Creating Multi-Column Layouts With Floats

* Use the `<div>` element to represent each column
* These CSS properties are used for positioning the columns next to each other: `width`, `float`, and `margin`

#### Layout Grids

pp. 387 - 394

#### Multiple Style Sheets

Two ways to add multiple style sheets to a page:

1. Your HTML page can link to one style sheet and that style sheet can use the `@import` rule to import other style sheets
  
  **Example on a CSS style sheet:**

  ```
  @import url("colors.css");
  @import url(fonts.css");
  ```

1. In the HTML you can use a separate `<link>` element for each style sheet
