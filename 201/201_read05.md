#### Adding Images

```
<img src="where the image is found" alt="a text description of the photo" title="some additional info" />
```

#### Animated GIFs

* show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations
* Each extra frame of the iamge increases the size fo the file

#### Transparency

* Transparent GIF
  * can save as GIF if the transparent part of the image has straight edges and is 100% transparent
* PNG
  * If the transparent part has diagonal or rounded edges, or if you want a semi-opaque transparency or a drop-shadow
  * Not fully supported in older browsers

#### HTML5: FIGURE AND FIGURE CAPTION
