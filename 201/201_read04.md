# Reading Assignment 04 

## HTML & CSS Textbook

### **Chapter 4: Links**

#### Linking to Other Sites

```
<a href="URL of page the link will take you to">Text user clicks on</a>
```

#### Linking to Other Pages on the Same Site

```
<a href="relative URL">Text user clicks on</a>
```

#### Directory Structure

* On larger websites it is beset to place pages for different section of the site into a new folder
* The top level folder is the root folder

#### Email Links

```
a href="mailto:email@example.com">Email Bob</a>
```

#### Opening Links in a New Window

```
<a href="destination" target="_blank">Text User Clicks On</a>
```

#### Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page

* Use ID selector:
  * In the opening `<a>` tag, href="#nameofID"
  * At the destination, give the desired element the ID attribute
    * **Example**: `<p id="nameofID">`

### **Chapter 15: Layout**

#### Key Concepts in Positioning Elements

* Block-level elements start on a new line
  * **Examples**: `<h1> <p> <ul> <li>`
* Inline elements flow between surrounding text
  * **Examples**: `<img> <b> <i>`

#### Containing Elements

* Block-level elements can be parents of other block-level elements
  * It is common to group a number of elements together inside a `<div>` element. E.g., grouping elements that form the header of a website

#### Controlling the Position of Elements

* When you move any element out of normal flow, boxes can overlap. The `z-index` property allows you to control which box appears on top.

#### Creating Multi-Column Layouts With Floats

* Use the `<div>` element to represent each column
* These CSS properties are used for positioning the columns next to each other: `width`, `float`, and `margin`

#### Layout Grids

pp. 387 - 394

#### Multiple Style Sheets

Two ways to add multiple style sheets to a page:

1. Your HTML page can link to one style sheet and that style sheet can use the `@import` rule to import other style sheets
  
  **Example on a CSS style sheet:**

  ```
  @import url("colors.css");
  @import url(fonts.css");
  ```

1. In the HTML you can use a separate `<link>` element for each style sheet

### **Chapter 3: Functions, Methods, and Objects pp. 86 - 99**

#### Functions

Functions are series of statements grouped together to accomplish a specific task

**Example**:

```
var greeting = function (
  var userName = prompt('What is your name?');
  document.write(`Hello, ${userName}!`);
)
greeting();
```

#### Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs)

```
var area = (function() {
  var width = 3;
  var height = 2;
  return width * height;
}());
```

* The pair of parentheses, which are the **final parentheses**, are right after the closing curly brace tell the interpreter to call the function immediately
* The grouping operatrors (the opening parens is right before the word function and the closing parens is right after the final parentheses) ensure the interpreter treats this as an expression

### Two Roles: Driver and Navigator

* **Driver** does all the typing
* **Navigator** thinks of big picture and what comes next to direct Driver; scans for errors; might look up solutions and documentation

### Reasons Why This Method is Better

* Greater efficiency; produces higher quality code
* Engaged Collaboration
  * Programmers are more focused than if working alone
  * Can tag team to troubleshoot and/or ask for help
* Learning from fellow students
  * They can teach each other techniques and solutions that the other might not have otherwise thought of
* Social skills: communication and working well with others is important and has long-term career impacts
* Job interview readiness
  * A common step in the interview process is pair programming between a current employee and an applicant
* Work environment readiness
  * Many companies that utilize pair programming expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product. New hires who otherwise have familiarity with the pair programming environement can hit the ground running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome.
