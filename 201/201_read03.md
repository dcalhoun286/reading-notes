# Reading Assignment 03

## HTML & CSS Textbook

### Chapter 3: Lists

#### Ordered and Unordered Lists

- There are ordered lists `<ol>` and unordered lists `<ul>`, each of which contain list items `<li>`
  - unordered lists will automatically be numbered by the browser, even if you make more additions

#### Definition Lists

- Definition lists `<dl>` are a series of terms and definitions `<dt>`

#### Nested Lists

Example from book:

```
<ul>
  <li>Mouses</li>
  <li>Pastries</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Croissant</li>
      <Mille-feuille</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tarts</li>
</ul>
```

### Chapter 13: Boxes

#### Box Dimensions

- When you use pixels, the box sizes are fixed
- When you use percentages, the box sizes are relative to the size of the browser window
- When you use ems, the size is based on the size of the text within it

#### Limiting Height (and width as well)

Example:

```
p {
  min-height: 20px;
  max-height: 40px;
}
```
#### Change Inline/Block

- `inline` makes a box-level element behave like an inline element
- `block` does the reverse of `inline`
- `inline-block` makes a block-level element flow like an inline while retaining other features of a block-level element
- `none` hies the element from the page

#### Shorthand for Border

To specify the width, style, and color of a border in one property:

```
p {
  border: 5px solid rgb(255, 0, 0);
}
```

#### Border IMages and Box Shadows (CSS3):

- `border-image` and `box-shadow`


#### Overflowing Content

Tells the browser what to do if the content within the box is larger than the box itself.

- `hidden` simply hides content that doesn't fit in the box, and `scroll` adds a scrollbar so users can scroll to see the missing content

  Example:

  ```
  pa {
    overflow: hidden;
  }
  pb {
    overflow: scroll;
  }
  ```

#### Border, Margin, and Padding

- `border` separates the edge of one box from another
- `margin` sits outside the edge of the border; you can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes
- `padding` is the space between the border of a box and the content inside it

#### Centering Content

To center a box on the page, you need to specify a `width` so that it doesn't take up the full width of the page. Conversely, when you specify the `width` of a box, `padding` and `margin` should be added to it as well

**Example:**

```
p {
  width: 200px;
  margin: 10px auto 10px auto;
}
```

- The `margin` property above goes from the top edge clockwise to the left (top, right, bottom, left)

## JavaScript Textbook

### Basic JavaScript Instructions - Review from Chapter 2

#### Creating Arrays, Changing Content in Arrays

**Example from book:**

```
// Create the array
var colors = ['white', 'black', custom];

// Update the third item in teh array
colors[2] = 'beige';

// Get the element with an id of colors
var el = document.getElementById('colors);

// Replace with third item from the array
el.textContent = colors[2];
```

### Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops pp 162 - 182

#### Type Coercion and Weak Typing

- If you use a data type JavaScript did not expect, it tries to make sense of the operation rather than report an error

- Data Types and Purposes
  - **string**: text
  - **number**: number
    - `NaN` is a value that is counted as a number. When a number is expected but not returned, such as attempting to do mathematical operations with data types other than numbers
  - **Boolean**: `true` or `false`
  - **null**: empty value
  - **undefined**: variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value

#### Loops

Loops check a condition. If the condition is `true`, the code block will run.

**For**:

```
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++>) {
  document.write(i);
}
```

**While**:

- if you do not know how many times the code should run, use a `while` loop. The code will run as long as the condition is `true`

**Do while**:

- The code block will always run at least once, even if the condition evaluates to be `false`. Otherwise, will run like a `while` loop

#### Key Loop Concepts:

- `break` tells the interpreter to go on to the next statement of code outside the loop

- `continue` tells the interpreter to stop the current iteration, and then update and check the condition again

- *Performance Issues*
  - when a browser comes across JavaScript, it will wait until it is done processing that script to do anything else
  - if a condition never returns `false`, you will have an **infinite loop**. Your script will break when the browser runs out of memory
