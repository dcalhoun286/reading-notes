# Reading Assignment 18

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Document the following vocabulary terms

- **BDD**: Behavior Driven Development: This is an agile development process that prioritizes describing application's behavior from the user's point of view, and encourages everyone involved to have a shared understanding of how the application works.
  - **Resource**: [specflow.org](https://specflow.org/bdd/)
- **Acceptance Tests**: The client and/or users test the product by using it to confirm it meets expectations, before moving the project to production.
  - **Resource**: [Guru99](https://www.guru99.com/user-acceptance-testing.html)
- **Mounting**: A series of methods that are called when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM
  - **Resource**: [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#mounting)
- **Build**: A build is kind of like a zipped version of your React app. It allows your React app to load faster on the web by requiring less HTTP requests.
  - **Resource**: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43830866/what-is-npm-run-build-in-create-react-app#:~:text=When%20a%20user%20visits%20your,the%20same%20with%20your%20JavaScript.)

### Answer the following prompts and cite any external sources

- **Does a deployed React application require a server?**
  - Yes, a deployed React application requires a server. React is a library that helps you build how an application is displayed to the user navigating the app.
- **Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?**
  - Testing a React app at the behavior level allows us to see more specifically how different pieces of the app are responding right when the event happens, rather than doing end-to-end testing when testing at the unit level.
- **What does `npm run build` do?**
  - According to a discussion on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43664200/what-is-the-difference-between-npm-install-and-npm-run-build#:~:text=npm%20run%20build%20%28%20is%20also,json%28.), `npm run build` runs whatever is designated in your "build" field within your "scripts" field.
- **Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application**
  - React uses a structure where you can build a tree of components, and manage properties of that app that persist called `state`. The data contained in `state` affect how the app is visually rendered.
