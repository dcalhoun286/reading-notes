# Reading Assignment - Class 39

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Document the following vocabulary terms

- **middleware**: Middleware is a chain of functions/code you can run to modify/handle/process code, before it is passed on to something else.
- **thunk**: Thunk is middleware that receives state's dispatch calls, and then returns a series of functions to run after it is done completing its asynchronous code. With basic Redux, dispatching an action is synchronous must return an object. However, thunk allows us to handle returning this object in an asynchronous way (such as making HTTP and CRUD requests).

### Answer the following prompts and cite any external sources

- **What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?**
  - I found this [Stack Overflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39356517/correct-way-to-pre-load-component-data-in-reactredux) that talks about using `componentWillMount` in a higher order component, but I believe this translates to using `useEffect` with functional components, and passing an empty object so that this method will only run once (the first time the component is rendered).
- **When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?**
  - Based on my research from this [freecodecamp article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/loading-data-in-react-redux-thunk-redux-saga-suspense-hooks-666b21da1569/), the function that is exported from the reducer is still what creates the action.
