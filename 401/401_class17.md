- **Server Instances**: A collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server.
  - Resource: [techopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32149/server-instance)
- **Containers**: Containers are like packages of executable code on a server.
  - Resource: [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/containers/)
- **Cloud Services**: Cloud services offer speed, flexibility, and reliability because software can be delivered over the internet and scaled as necessary.
- **Cloud Architecture**: Cloud Architecture is the different necessary technology components that fit together to make cloud computing possible.
  - Resource: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X43KVeWVkSY)
- **AWS**: Is a type of cloud computing platform.
- **EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku**: Heroku is a cloud computing platform that actually relies on AWS services such as EC2/Beanstalk, and removes a layer of complexity required by EC2/Beanstalk by making it more ready to use. Heroku requires less maintenance and tech skills, but AWS has more capacity for cloud computing and is more secure.

### Answer the followign prompts and cite any external sources

- **What's the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?**
  - A standard queue has a much greater capacity than a FIFO queue to process instances. However, FIFO queues ensure that the correct order is maintained and each instance is processed only one time.
- **How can a server be assured a message was properly received?**
  - Ideally the client app would emit a message confirming receipt of the message from the server.
- **What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?**
  - Event-driven architecture. Client apps can pass data to each other because even though they aren't directly connected to one another, they are connected to the server/hub which relays the information.
- **How do you test an event driven system?**
  - Use `jest` to spy on whether a certain function has run. You could also create a fake payload to confirm whether or not it was properly passed.
