# Reading Assignment - Class 36

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Document the following vocabulary terms

- **cookies**: files containing code that websites store on your browser that contains information about who you are as a user
- **authorization**: Authorization involves different ways in which a server might authenticate which (if any) `HTTP` requests a client can make and under which circumstances, depending on the access privileges a user associated with that client has been given.
- **access control**: This is also known as role-based authorization. All users are given the same base-level general authorizations when those users are created and stored into the database. However, certain groups of users might have more privileges that allow them access to certain data and what to do with that data. For example, all users might be able to generally access the website if they are a successfully registered user; however, an editor might be the lowest level user who can access the list of all users registered and edit those users, and an admin might be the lowest level user who can delete that user from the registry altogether.
- **conditional rendering**: In React, certain components will appear on the DOM for the user to see (and/or interact with), but only if a certain condition returns `true`.

- **How do pixel tags work?**
  - Pixel tags are similar to cookies in that they collect information about user behavior across different sites. They are snippets of code put into a 1x1 pixel graphic that loads when a user visits a website, collecting information about that user as well as what that user visits and engages with throughout the site.
