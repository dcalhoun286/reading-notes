# Reading Assignment 23

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Document the following vocabulary terms

- **reducer**: this is a hook that can be used in a React app if the next state of a component rendered is dependent on the previous state, especially if multiple iterations will be performed

### Answer the following prompts and cite any external sources

- **Describe use cases for `useMemo()` and `useReducer()`**
  - `useMemo()`: A React hook that memorizes the output of a function. If the dependencies it is watching has changed, this hook will run the function when called. If not, it will return the cached value.
    - **Resource**: [everyday.codes](https://everyday.codes/javascript/react-usememo-and-when-you-should-use-it/#:~:text=useMemo%20is%20a%20React%20hook,and%20return%20its%20return%20value.&text=If%20they%20have%20changed%2C%20useMemo,again%20and%20repeat%20the%20process.)
  -`useReducer()`: This hook is helpful in cases for which state makes many iterative changes (such as a counter) and when it needs to be reset.
- **What do custom hooks usually do?**
  - Custom hooks help modularize code so that it can be reused.
- **Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications**
  - This hook looks really helpful for handling authorization tokens

- **Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work**
  - A parent component might receive data sent up from a child Form component regarding what HTTP request the client wants to make, then send that info to that hook. Within the hook an HTTP request is run, and a number of things can be done to the result of that request before it is sent back up to the parent component, depending on how the hook is written and the purpose of the hook.
