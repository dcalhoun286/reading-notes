### [JWTs Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=926mknSW9Lo)

JWT - JSON Web Token

- Open standard (anyone can use it)
- Securely transfer information between any two bodies
- Digitally Signed: Information is verified and trusted
- Compact
  - can be sent via URL, POST request, HTTP Header
  - Fast Transmission
- Self-contained
  - contains info about the user
  - avoiding query the database more than once

What is the JSON Web Token structure?

- Header
  - two fields:
    - `alg` algorithm like HMAC SHA26 or RSA
    - `typ` type of JWT token
  - This JSON is then Base64Url encoded to form first part
- Payload
  - three fields: `sub` (string), `name` (string), `admin` (true or false)
  - It contains claims which are user details or additional metadata. This is then encoded to form second part
- Signature
  - Combine base64 Header & Payload with secret

How do JSON Web Tokens work?

- client makes post request to login with credentials
- a JWT is generated via secret on the server side
- the JWT is returned to the browser
- the browser sends the JWT on the Authorization Header
- the server checks JWT Signature and gets user info if req is valid
- server sends response to client

### [Intro to JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction/)

A JWT typically looks like the following: `aaaaaa.bbbbbb.cccccc`

**Header** - Example:
```javascript
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

**Payload**

- Registered claims: predefined claims that aren't mandatory but recommended
  - [Registered claim names](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1)
- Public claims: can be defined at will by those using JWTs, but recommended to define in the [IANA JSON Web Token Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml)
- Private Claims: are neither registered nor public; shared between parties that agree on using them

Example payload:

```javascript
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
}
```

- *ALWAYS* encrypt secret info before putting in the payload or header elements of a JWT

**Signature**

```
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  bsae64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)
```

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Document the following vocabulary terms

- **Client ID**: data that identifies who the user is
- **Client Secret**: used by OAuth; adds another layer of authentication
  - [oauth.com](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/client-registration/client-id-secret/)
- **Authentication Endpoint**: validates whether client can access based on credentials received
- **Access Token Endpoint**: gives an access token; validates an access token
- **API Endpoint**: Where an API requests data (URL)
- **Authorization Code**: alphanumeric password returned to client
  - [openid.net](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth)
- **Access Token**: after a user authenticates/authorizes access, the token is used as a credential when API is called
  - [auth0.com](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/access-tokens)

### Answer the following prompts and cite any external sources

I based my answers on the external sources listed above

**Write the following steps in teh correct order**

1. Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
1. Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
1. Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
1. Receive authorization code
1. Make a request to the access token endpoint
1. Receive access token
1. Make request to third-party API endpoint

**What can you do with an authorization code?**

With a valid authorization code, you can request an access token be made on the server side or have an already-generated token in the response body

**What can you do with an access token?**

An access token is what gives permission for HTTP requests to be successful, such as logging in to an online account, or completing a purchase

**What's a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?**

OAuth ensures that another layer of security (encryption) is placed on sensitive data that is passed over the internet so that the data is not vulnerable to malicious intent
