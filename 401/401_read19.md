# Reading Assignment 19

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Document the following vocabulary terms

- **component props**: `props` is used to pass data to different components within an app by adding attributes on JSX tags
- **component state**: These are properties that affect how a component is rendered on the React DOM. Any time a state property of a component changes, that component will be re-rendered. State can be passed to child components, but not parent components.
- **application state**: I think this is referring to memory storage on a global level for the application.

### Answer the following prompts and cite any external sources

- **Can a parent component access the state of a child component?**
  - A parent component can access the child's state using `Ref`.
    - Resource: [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-access-childs-state-in-react/#:~:text=In%20React%20we%20can%20access,Refs%20are%20created%20using%20React.)
- **What can be passed along in a prop variable?**
  - Any kind of valid JavaScript object can be passed in a prop variable.
- **How can a child component "know" the state of another component?**
  - This is only possible if a child component's sibling passes its state data to the parent, and the parent stores that data as a prop so that it is accessible to that child. A component cannot directly access the state of a sibling component.
