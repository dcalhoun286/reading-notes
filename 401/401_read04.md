### [SQL vs NoSQL (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS_kXvOeQ5Y)

- SQL: **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage
  - Best if you desire a clear schema, if you use many relations, if you work with a lot of data that changes frequently and used on multiple parts of your application
  - Example: MySQL
  - SQL syntax/keywords
    - Example:
      ```sql
      SELECT id, name, price FROM products
      ```
  - Database Structure
    - In a table, there are fields (columns) and records (rows)
    - data is distributed across multiple tables
    - Advantages:
      - Managing data from only one table
      - vertical scaling is possible
    - Disadvantages:
      - All records in a table must follow the specified Schema which might be too rigid
      - Horizontal scaling is difficult/impossible
    - **Relations**
      - Types:
        - one-to-one
        - one-to-many
        - many-to-many
      - connecting data: `JOINS`
- NoSQL
  - good for applications that you want to read and write a lot but not doing a lot of updating, have only a few features that are used heavily; if you need to read and display a lot of data quickly; if scaling matters and horizontal scaling would be better
  - Example: MongoDB
  - Database -> Collections
    - Documents:
      - JSON format
      - You can have multiple documents in one collection with different fields. More flexible because no schema implied
      - Relational data needs to be merged manually because
      - Advantages:
        - Both horizontal and vertical scaling is possible
        - greate performance for mass (simple) read and write requests
      - Disadvantages:
        - Risk of duplicate data because no (or very few) Relations between collections
        - If data changes, you have to update multiple collections (which is not efficient if you are constantly updating large amounts of data)

### [SQL vs NoSQL (thegeekstuff.com)](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

- SQL databases (Relational Databases)
  - **Examples**:
    - [MySQl](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/07/howto-install-mysql-on-linux/)
      - MySQL Community Edition
        - available for all major platforms (e.g., Linux, Windows, Mac, BSD, Solaris)
        - Connectors to languages like Node.js, Ruby, C#, C++, Java, Perl, PHP and Python
      - MS-SQL Server Express Edition
    - [Oracle Express Edition](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/10/oracle-11g-step-by-step-installation-guide-with-screenshots/)
- NoSQL databases (non-relational/distributed databases)
  - **Examples**:
    - [MongoDB](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2013/01/install-mongodb/)
      - good performance for simple queries
    - [CouchDB](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/06/install-couch-db/)
    - [Redis](http://redis.io/)

### [NoSQL Data Modeling Techniques (Highly Scalable Blog)](https://highlyscalable.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/nosql-data-modeling-techniques/)

- Data modeling driven by application-specific access patterns. Main design theme: "What questions do I have?"
- Often requires a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms than SQL modeling
- **Conceptual Techniques**
  - Denormalization
  - Aggregates
  - Application Side Joins
- **General Modeling Techniques**:
  - Atomic aggregates
  - Enumerable keys
  - Dimensionality reduction
  - Index Table
  - Composite Key Index
  - Aggregation with Composite Keys
  - Inverted Search - Direct Aggregation
  - Tree Agregation
- **Hierarchy Modeling Techniques**:
  - Tree Aggregation
  - Adjacency Lists
  - Materialized Paths
  - Nested Sets
  - Nested Documents Flattening
    - Numbered Field Names
    - Proximity Queries
  - Batch Graph Processing

## Review, Research, and Discussion

- **Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development**
- **In what case would you need to use `beforeEach()` or `afterEach()` in a test suite?**
- **What is one downside of Test Driven Development?**
- **What's the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?**
- **Why REST?**

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- **Functional programming**:
  - Software is composed using pure functions (avoid shared state, mutable data, side-effects)
  - If functions are interrelated, changing one function could break everything else
    - Resource: [Medium.com](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0)
- **Object-oriented programming (OOP)**: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism
  - Related properties and methods can be grouped together
  - Resource: [Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTB0EiLXUC8)
- **Class**: [(Resource: MDN Docs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
  - templates for creating objects. The `constructor()` method is used for creating and initializing an object created with a `class`. Can only be one `constructor()` per class
- **`super`**: this is used to call the constructor of the super (parent) class
- **`this`**: `this` refers to the current object being instantiated
- **Test Driven Development (TDD)**:
  - Coding, testing (unit tests), and design (refactoring) â€“ each functionality piece has a test case, and code is written as simply as possible
  - **Resource**: [Guru99](https://www.guru99.com/test-driven-development.html)
- **Jest**: JavaScript Testing Framework; Jest runs previously failed tests first and reorganizes runs based on how long test files take
  - **Resource**: [JestJS](https://jestjs.io/)
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
  - consistent merging from multiple places into one multiple times a day
- **REST**: **Re**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer. Uses HTTP requests to retrieve/use data
- **Data Model**: Data model is a diagram that illustrates relationships and behaviors of different pieces of an application and how those pieces depend on one another
