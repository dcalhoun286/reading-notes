### [OSI Model Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv4y_uOneC0)

- Application Layer
- Presentation Layer
- Session Layer
- Transport Layer
- Network Layer
- Data Link Layer
- Physical Layer

### [TCP Handshakes Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtP5ZB3wSk)

- Before TCP transmits data, it will use a three-way handshake to establish a connection
  - **Step 1**: Client sends a SYN segment to server, asking for synchronization (connection)
  - **Step 2**: Server replies with SYN-ACK (synchronization-acknowledgment) and asks client to open a connection
  - **Step 3**: Client sends ACK to server agreeing to connection, and connection channel is open

### Socket.io and Web Sockets

**Resources**:

- [Web Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)
- [Socket.io Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/socket.io/)
- [Socket.io vs Web Sockets](https://www.educba.com/websocket-vs-socket-io/)

I actually got better sense of Web Sockets, Socket.io, and the differences between the two by visiting a discussion on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10112178/differences-between-socket-io-and-websockets). Some of the points I gathered:

- Socket.io uses an older approach of receiving info by making `ajax` calls
- WebSockets work on most modern browsers, whereas Socket.io works on all browsers
- Both allow for real-time two way network communication
- WebSockets do not allow for automatic reconnection if connection is lost, whereas Socket.io will handle reconnection for you

## Review, Research, and Discussion
