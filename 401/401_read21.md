# Reading Assignment 21

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Document the following vocabulary terms

- **Composition**: Composition is a development model in React where components are built with other components, utilizing `props`
- **Children**: Children is any components within an opening and closing tag of a component
- **Hash routing**: React router handles rendering of this, not the server. Intended mainly to support legacy browsers.
  - **Resource**: [learnwithparam.com](https://learnwithparam.com/blog/different-types-of-router-in-react-router/#:~:text=Hash%20value%20will%20be%20handled,who%20created%20react%20router%20package.)
- **Link routing**: `<Link>` components help a user navigate to different parts/pages of your React app

### Answer the following prompts and cite any external sources

- **Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?**
  - We only need one html page, `index.html`, which represents the home route of an app. To create more pages, you invoke the `<Route />` component, and designate the `exact path` as an attribute of that component you invoke.
- **If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?**
  - **Outside the `<BrowserRouter />`**
  - **Inside the `<BrowserRouter />` outside a `<Route />`**
    - The component needs to be rendered here and outside of a `<Route />` because everything contained in `<BrowserRouther />` is what tells the React DOM what URLs to render and how to render/display them. Putting a component as a child of a `<Route />` is telling React DOM that you only want that component displayed for that specific .html page.
  - **Inside a `<Route />`**
- **What does props.children contain?**
  - Content rendered within a component's opening and closing tags

### Using Hooks

Hooks are a way of using *stateful logic*, but you're not using state itself.

Hooks are JavaScript functions that impose two additional rules:

- Only call Hooks at the top level; don't call inside loops, conditions, nested functions
- Only call Hooks from React function components.

Using the Effect Hook

- Lets you perform side effects in function components; you are telling React that your component needs to do something after render.
