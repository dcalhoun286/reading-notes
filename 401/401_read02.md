### [An introduction to NodeJS and Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

Express is what handles requests for different HTTP verbs

Middleware for serving static files (native to Express):

```javascript
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

- images, CSS files, JavaScript files go into a directory named 'public', which is at the same level as where you call node
- File paths for static files are relative to the base "public" directory
  - **Example**: `http://localhost:3000/css/reset.css`

Route handling methods other than `DELETE`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `GET`:

- `checkout()`
- `copy()`
- `head()`
- `lock()`
- `merge()`
- `mkactivity()`
- `mkcol()`
- `move()`
- `m-search()`
- `notify()`
- `options()`
- `patch()`
- `purge()`
- `report()`
- `search()`
- `subscribe()`
- `trace()`
- `unlock()`
- `unsubscribe()`
- **_SPECIAL ROUTING METHOD_**: `app.all()`
  - used for loading middleware functions at a particular path for all request methods

`express.Router` object

- can use for grouping route handlers into one related file and then exporting them using the `express.Router` object

Using `path` object:

```javascript
const path = require('express');
// set directory to contain the templates ('views')
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
// set view engine to use
app.set('view engine', 'some_template_engine_name');
```

### [What is NPM?](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)

- open-source software registry; most developers interact with the CLI form using their terminal
- browse different packages on the website itself: [https://npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com/)

### [What is TDD?](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/)

TDD: Test-driven development

- Coding, testing (writing unit tests) and design (in the form of refactoring)

### [CI/CD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSv_m3KhUO8)

- Continuous Integration (CI) - ensure eveyone's changes will integrate so that you can catch bugs, reduce merge conflicts
  - Does the code pass the tests?
  - Does the code integrate well with what's at the main branch?
- Continuous Delivery (CD) - develop to release at any time
- Continuous Deployment - extension of continuous delivery: deploy new features immediately

## Review, Research, and Discussion

- **What's the difference between `PUT` and `PATCH`?**
  - if the client makes a request with `PUT`, it overwrites the entire resource if it already exists
  - With `PATCH`, updating a resource will only update the specific piece of data you send
- **Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to "mock" an API for development like [`json-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)**
  - [Mirage JS](https://miragejs.com)
  - [Wiremock](http://wiremock.org/)
  - [Mock Service Worker](https://github.com/mswjs/msw)
- **Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js. Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?**
  - Swagger:
    - more popular of the two
    - expected to cover successful responses and any known errors, and each response status requires a description
    - [Swagger.io](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-responses/)
    - Due to popularity of Swagger, APIDoc.js provides info about apidoc-swagger converter
      - [ASPtricks.net](https://www.asptricks.net/2019/04/apidoc-vs-swagger-for-node-app.html)
  - APIDoc.js:
    - creates a documentation from API descriptions in your source code
    - can be installed from your terminal
    - API calls that are unsuccessful are handled with `res.status(500)` and a `.catch()` statement
    - [APIDocjs.com](https://apidocjs.com/)
- **Compare and contrast SOAP and REST**
  - I used this [article from Guru99](https://www.guru99.com/comparison-between-web-services.html) to research the comparisons
  - **SOAP**: Simple Object Access Protocol
    - When to use SOAP:
      - asynchronous processing and subsequent invocation
      - a Fromal means of communication
      - stateful operations, meaning if the application has a requirement that state needs to be maintained from one request to another
    - Challenges:
      - WSDL 
        - WSDL modifications may require all clients currently connecting to this web services to make corresponding change in their code
        - Document size can interfere with bandwidth
  - **REST**: Representational State Transfer
    - When to use REST:
      - limited resources and bandwidth
      - statelessness
      - caching
      - ease of coding
    - Challenges:
      - Lack of security
        - confidential data should never be used with REST to pas between client and server
      - Lack of state
        - this puts more burden on the client making app heavier and difficult to maintain


### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- **Web Server**
  - a computer or group of computers that run websites
- **Express** ([MDN Docs: Express/Node Introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)
  - Express is a Node web framework
  - provides mechanisms to:
    - write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes)
    - integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates
    - set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response
    - add additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline

- **Routing** ([Express.js](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html))
  - refers to how an application's endpoints (Uniform Resource Identifiers, or URIs) respond to client requests
- **WRRC** ([Web Request Response Cycle](https://medium.com/@jen_strong/the-request-response-cycle-of-the-web-1b7e206e9047))
  - the client asks the server for a specific resource communicated through the URL with some parameters (how the client wants to interact with it).
  - there are different types of request methods, such as `PUT`, `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE`
  - the response comes from the server in the form of a status code. If the request was successful, the resource will be given (i.e., `res.status(200)`). If not, an error has occured (e.g., `res.status(500)`)
