# Reading Assignment - Class 16

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Document the following vocabulary terms

- **Server**: A hub/program that manages and processes data, where it goes, and in what form the data is sent

- **Pub/Sub**: A client application emits an event to the server, and the server relays that event that all client apps can hear.

- **WRRC**: Web Request Response Cycle. A client makes an HTTP request to the server. The server checks to see if this request needs to be modified, if the request is authorized, and whether or not the request is legitimate. It will perform CRUD requests with a database (if need be) or API requests to another server (if need be). Then, the server responds with a status code back to the client to interpret.

### Answer the following prompts and cite any external sources

- **What's the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?**
  - a FIFO queue has less capacity to handle objects being passed through the queue than a standard queue, but FIFO ensures that each object is only being processed once.
- **How can the server be assured a message was properly received?**
  - It can expect the client to confirm that it received a message
- **What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?**
  - Event-driven architecture, which allows for different clients to "communicate" with each other without being directly connected
- **How do you test an event driven system?**
  - You can use `jest` to spy on whether a certain function is called

### [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?ec2-whats-new.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&ec2-whats-new.sort-order=desc)

- A really beneficial feature of this software is you only pay for the resources you consume (there isn't a flat rate fee). This means in order to avoid being charged for data traffic that your application processes using EC2, you can simply hibernate the application.

- Launching an instance:
  - When prompted for a key pair, choose an existing key pair. **Do not proceed without a key pair.**
- Connecting to an instance:
  - [Connection options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html)
- Cleaning up your instance:
  - [Terminating an instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html#ec2-clean-up-your-instance)

### [EC2 For Humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZMkgOMYYIg)

- Launching an instance
  - Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
    - Amazon Linux AMI
  - Choose an Instance Type
    - think about the tasks you need to run and the power you need to accomplish those tasks
  - Configure Instance Details
   - can specify number of instances, purchasing option, network settings, access roles, stopping or terminating instances, storage
   - If you want storage to persist, you need to purchase external storage
  - Configure Security Group
    - Set a range of IP address ranges that can access your instance. **NEVER** select all
  - Review Instance
    - Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair
      - Download and safely store your key pair. If it is lost, you will never be able to access your instance
- Connect to the instance
  - Change permissions of `.pem` file to read-only:
    - `chmod 400 <filename>`

### [Elastic Beanstalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrwxAScdyT0)

- Takes the work of managing a server and its capacity needs from you
- Can scale your application up/down based on settings
