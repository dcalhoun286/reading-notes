# Reading Assignment - Class 19

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Document the following vocabulary terms

- **Serverless API**: Cloud-based programming that manages authorization of connections between different endpoints and how data is passed between them
- **Triggers**: Triggers are thresholds that must be met for an event listener to run the callback function.
- **Dynamo vs Mongo**: Dynamo and Mongo are both highly scalable data storage systems. Dynamo is modeled after Mongo, but Dynamo is part of AWS's cloud-computing services, whereas Mongo requires more management.
- **Dynamoose vs Mongoose**: Dynamoose and Mongoose are the program setups that give the ability to make CRUD actions to the Dynamo and Mongo databases, respectively.

### Answer the following prompts and cite any external sources

- **What's the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?**
  - FIFO ensures that the order in which objects are processed is kept . It is more expensive to pass data this way and the capacity to process objects over a certain amount of time is relatively less, but it also ensures that objects are only passed once. Standard queues do not ensure that order is maintained, but the amount of data it can handle is very high.
- **How can the server be assured a message was properly received?**
  - The client app can emit an event that the server would be expecting.
- **What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?**
  - Event-driven architecture: The server is the main hub to which the client apps are connected, and is the medium of communication between the client apps
- **How do you test an event driven system?**
  - If serverless, you can set up an environment where you can see how the different aspects of your application are responding to the events being fired off

## Preview - Preparation Materials

### [SQS and SNS Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UesxWuZMZqI)

- Simple Queue Service (SQS): Standard queue that will scale as your data persistence needs grow. FIFO ensures order is maintained and messages not processed more than onc
- Simple Notification Service (SNS): Publisher send a topic to the cloud that will be broadcast, which certain subscribers are listening for

### [AWS SQS vs SNS](https://medium.com/awesome-cloud/aws-difference-between-sqs-and-sns-61a397bf76c5)

- SNS
  - Messages are pushed to subscribers in real time when publishers send to SNS
  - no persistence
  - consumers process the messages in different ways
- SQS
  - Receivers have to poll SQS to receive messages
  - messages can persist for a configured duration if no consumer is available
