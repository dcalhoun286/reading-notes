# Reading Assignment 20

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Document the following vocabulary terms

- **props.children**: Content rendered within a component's opening and closing tags
  - **Resource**: [Learn.co](https://learn.co/lessons/react-this-props-children)
- **composition**: Composition is building components from other components and utilizing `props`
  - **Resource**: [Dev.to](https://dev.to/bouhm/thinking-in-react-component-composition-fp5)

### Answer the following prompts and cite any external sources

- **Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?**
  - No, child components only have access to what the parent component passes to them.
- **When a component 'wraps' another component, how does the child component's output get rendered?**
  - ```jsx
    <Main>
      <Content />
    </Main>
    ```
- **Can a component, such as `<Content />`, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?**
  - I see no reason why it could not be used as a standalone component in another area in the application. Regardless of where it is, things just need to be wired properly so that data can successfully pass between it and other components.
- **What trick can a parent use to share all `props` with its children?**
  - You can use the spread operator to pass all of the props at once: `{...props}`
