# Reading Assignment - Class 41

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Document the following vocabulary terms

- **redux toolkit slices**: A function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state.
  - [redux-toolkit.js.org](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createSlice)
- **namespace**: From my reading it seems as though namespacing controls scope, and if a reducer is associated with a namespace, anything that needs to access that reducer needs to be located within that namespace.

### Answer the following prompts and cite any external sources

- **Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux "Ducks"**
  - Toolkit and Ducks are both tools that allow you to more easily write reducers for a Redux program. Toolkit, however, is much less opinionated than Ducks.

- **What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit?**
  - It allows us to write more efficient code, makes it easier to write code, and speeds up the development process.
