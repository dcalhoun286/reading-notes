## Preview - Preparation Materials

### [Securing Passwords](https://thehackernews.com/2014/04/securing-passwords-with-bcrypt-hashing.html)

- Cryptographic hash algorithms
  - Examples:
    - MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, SHA-3
  - Problems with cryptographic hash algorithm
    - **Brute Force attack**: when a computer attempts every combination of characters possible until finding a password that matches the hash value stored in the database.
    - **Hash Collision attack**: two input strings of a hash function that produce the same hash result.
- Bcrypt
 - make's a hacker's efforts much more slower
 - good for most applications that need to store sensitive data.

### [Basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)

- An HTTP user agent provides a user name and password when making a request. Simple because this method uses standard fields in the HTTP header.
- No confidentiality protection

#### Protocol

- Server side
  - To unauthenticated requests, the server should return a response whose header contains a *HTTP 401 Unauthorized* status and a *WWW-Authenticate* field

- Client side
  - it may use the *Authorization* field:
    1. username and password are combined with a single colon
    1. The resulting string is encoded into an octed sequence
    1. The resulting string is encoded using a variant of Base64and with padding
    1. Authorization method and a space is then prepended to the encoded string

### [Authentication Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)

- **Authentication**: verifying that an entity is whom it claims to be
- **Session Management**: a process by which a server maintains the state of an entity interacting with it. With this server will know how to respond to subsequent client requests.

#### Authentication General Guidelines

- User IDs
  - use case-insensitive user IDs
- Email address as a User ID
  - [input validation cheatsheet email discussion](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html#Email_Address_Validation)
- Authentication Solution and Sensitive Accounts
  - Do not allow login with sensitive accounts
  - Do not use the same authentication solution used internally for unsecured access
- Implement Proper Password Strength Controls
  - Password Length
    - enforce a minimum length of characters
    - max password length should not be set too low for users to create passphrases
  - Do not silently truncate passwords
    - [Password Storage Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#maximum-password-lengths)
  - Allow usage of all characters including unicode and whitespace.
  - Ensure credential rotation when a password leak, or at the time of compromise identification
  - Include password strength meter to help users create a more complex password and block common and previously breached passwords

    - [Pwned Passwords](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords)
    - [ASVS v4.0 Password Security Requirements](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/4.0/en/0x11-V2-Authentication.md#v21-password-security-requirements)
    - [Passwords Evolved: Authentication Guidance for the Modern Era](https://www.troyhunt.com/passwords-evolved-authentication-guidance-for-the-modern-era/)
- Implement secure password recovery mechanism
- Store passwords in a secure fashion
- Compare password hashes using safe functions
- Transmit passwords only over TLS or other strong transport
  - [Transport layer protection cheat sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet.html)
- Require re-authentication for sensitive features
- Consider strong transaction authentication
  - [Transaction authorization cheat sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transaction_Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html)
- Authentication and error messages
  - an application should respond in a generic manner
  - **Appropriate authentication responses**
    - Login: "Login failed; invalid user ID or password"
    - Password recovery: "If that email address is in our database, we ill send you an email to reset your password"
    - Account creation: "A link to activate your account has been emailed to the address provided"
  - [error handling cheat sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Error_Handling_Cheat_Sheet.html)
- Protect against automated attacks
  - Most common attack types
    - **Brute force**: testing multiple passwords from a dictionary or other source against a single account
    - **Credential stuffing**: Testing username/assword pairs obtained from the breach of another site
    - **Password spraying**: Testing a single weak password against a large number of different accounts
  - Mult-factor authentication
    [cheat sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Multifactor_Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)
  - Account lockout: lockout threshold; observation window; lockout duration
  - CAPTCHA
    - due to weaknesses, this method should be viewed to make brute-force attacks more time consuming and expensive, and not to use as a preventive
  - Security questions and memorable words
    - [Choosing and using security questions](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Choosing_and_Using_Security_Questions_Cheat_Sheet.html)
- Logging and monitoring
  - Enable logging and monitoring of authentication functions to detect attacks/failures on a real-time basis
- Use of authentication protocols that require no password
  - Open authorization (OAuth)
  - OpenId
  - SAML
  - FIDO
- Password managers
  - web applications should not make password managers job more difficult than necessary by observing the above recommendations

### [node.bcrypt.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)

- A library for hasing passwords
- Installation
  - `npm install bcrypt`
- Usage

```javascript
// async (recommended)
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const saltRounds = 10;
const myPlaintextPassword = 's0\/\/P4$$w0rD';
const someOtherPlaintextPassword = 'not_bacon';

// hashing a password - technique 1: generate a salt and hash on separate function calls. 
bcrypt.genSalt(saltRounds, function(err, salt) {
  bcrypt.hash(myPlaintextPassword, salt, function(err, hash) {
    // store hash in password db
  });
});

//technique 2: auto-gen a salt and hash. store hash in password db
bcrypt.hash(myPlaintextPassword, salt, function(err, hash) {
  // store hash in password db
})

// checking a password

bcrypt.compare(myPlaintextPassword, hash, function(err, result) {
  // result == true
});
bcrypt.compare(someOtherPlaintextPassword, hash, function(err, result) {
  // result == false
});
```

## Review, Research, and Discussion

- **Singleton**: a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance
  - Resource: [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton)
  - A Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules by putting the name of the class within a `module.exports` object
    - Example:
    ```javascript
    // recreation.js file
    class Recreation {
      constructor(city, park) {
        this.city = city;
        this.park = park;
      }
    }

    module.exports = Recreation;

    // adventure.js file
    const Recreation = require('recreation.js');

    const greenlake = new Recreation('Seattle', 'Greenlake');
    ```

  - **If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?**
    - I would make my middlewar modular. This cleans up our other files by importing the middleware to that file as a dependency, as well as only writing it where it is needed. I would also use the Singleton method using semantic naming to reduce the risk of bugs due to forgetting the proper reference to a middleware file.

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- **Router Middleware**: router middleware can modify the `req` and `res` objects that are passed between the server and the client, as well as end the WRRC depending on authentication of the information in the `req` and `res` objects. For the next middleware in the middleware chain to be called, you must use the `next` method at the end of the function
- **Dynamic Module Loading**: modules are only loaded when they are needed, instead of being loaded upfront (and thus taking up space regardless of whether they are actually called)
  - Resource: [MDN Docs: JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
- **Singleton Pattern**: when a function or class is declared, and then is exported within the `module.exports` call
- **CRUD --> REST Method Matches**
  - **C**reate: --> **P**OST
  - **R**ead: --> **G**ET
  - **U**pdate: --> **P**UT
  - **D**estroy: --> **D**ELETE
- **Mock Testing**: mock testing methods are used within `.test.js` files to ensure proper functionality of server components such as HTTP requests/responses between the server and client, as well as CRUD requests/responses between the server and database.
