What I have learned today:

* It is vitally important to have a remote copy of the data saved to the server.
    *I learned how to clone what I have on GitHub to my local computer file
    *I learned how to add/edit files using a Text Editor (VS Code) and then commit/publish those changes to GitHub via Terminal
