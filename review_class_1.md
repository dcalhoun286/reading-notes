# Review Class 01

## Growth Mindset is the commitment to push and challenge oneself to learn new things and adapt.

* When I tell myself I'm not good at this, I remind myself **no one is when they first begin.**
* When I am tempted to believe "this is as good as I will get", I remind myself that with growth comes effort, which should be challenging.
* I remember that it is okay to take more than one approach to learning something, and to take a few breather minutes when I become too frustrated.
