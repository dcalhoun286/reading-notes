What I have learned from Reading 3:

* It is vitally important to have a remote copy of the data saved to the server.
    *I learned how to clone what I have on GitHub to my local computer file
    *I learned how to add/edit files using a Text Editor (VS Code) and then commit/publish those changes to GitHub via Terminal
    *I learned that with Git I can go back to an earlier snapshot of my work if I find that my commits weren't helpful
    * **NEVER** edit directly on GitHub after a repo remote copy has been added
        * Repositories can also be created via Terminal and then pushed to GitHub server
* Remember add, commit, push (A, C, P) for all changes

* If I want to view all of my remote URLs, I can run this command:
```
    git remote -v
```
