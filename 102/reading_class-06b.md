# Reading Class 06b: How Computers Work

#### What Makes a Computer, a Computer?

* Machines designed to manipulate info
    * **Input**
        * Many types of input: mouse, keyboard, touch screen, audio (microphone)
    * **Storage**
        * info stored in memory
    * **Processing**
        * takes info stored in memory, manipulates it with algorithm (a series of commands), stores in memory again
        * process continues until info is ready to be output
    * **Output**
        * how a computer outputs info depends on what it is designed to do
        * on the web, output from one computer could become input for another

#### Binary and Data

* almost nobody today directly interacts with binary although they still play a big role in what happens on inside

* on/off state: called a bit (smallest piece of info a computer can store)
    * more bits means more complicated info

* binary: zeros and ones
    * Any number can be represented with just ones and zeroes or on/off wires
    * even texts, images, and sound are represented by binary
    * all data on a computer is represented with binary code
        * images have pixels; pixels are a certain color; each color represented with numbers
            * millions of pieces of data!
    * Sound is just waves
        * waveform on a graph represented with numbers

#### Circuits and Logic

* in order to process input to make output, computer modifies and combines info with circuits

* circuit takes a signal and flips it
    * complicated circuits take multiple signals and combine them to give different results
    * multiple types of circuits (logic gates)



* Back in the day, circuits were HUGE

* Modern circuits are much smaller (the smaller the circuit, the shorter the distance a piece of information has to go)

#### CPU, Memory, Input, and Output

* To display for example, a letter, a computer runs thousands of instructions to output the info onto the screen

* different inputs and outputs available today is due to advancements in technology to increase speed and decrease size of circuits

#### Hardware and Software

* Hardware
    * Examples: circuits, chips, wires, speakers, plugs
* Software (code running on th emachine)
    * Examples: apps, games, websites, maps

* How do the hardware and software interact with one another?
    * Central Processing Unit (CPU) -- master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer
        * knows which circuits to use and when to use them
    * Software languages - "high level" languages
        * single command broken down into *many* pieces of info that the computer can understand, *really* fast

* Computers are only as smart as the people who make and use themn(YOU control it!)
